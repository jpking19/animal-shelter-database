Assignment 3 - Full Stack: Basic Database-enabled Web Application using HTML/CSS/JS and Node.js  
===

## Jason King | Animal Shelter Database
My project 3 is a fullstack application that allows an animal shelter employee to interface with a database of pet records. The user can store information about pets, update that information, and eventually delete the record containing the pet's information when it is longer at the shelter. I chose to use Postgres as my database, and fully integrated it with heroku so that the pg add-on is deployed.

## Technical Achievements
- **Tech Achievement 1**: Can edit pet information through a form
- **Tech Achievement 2**: Form validates that user has inputed all required information in the correct format (integer required in age field) so that empty information can't be stored in the database
- **Tech Achievement 3**: Can delete multiple pets from the database at the same time

### Design/Evaluation Achievements
- **Design Achievement 1**: Form designed to be appealing and easy to use
- **Design Achievement 2**: Created CSS animations for input validation on the form (makes it clear to users when they forget to enter the correct information)
